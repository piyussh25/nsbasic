 <h1 id="abt"> ABOUT NSS </h1>
 <P>  
The National Service Scheme (NSS) was launched in 1969 by the Government of India under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. It was initiated on the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi to promote his ideals of selfless service and community involvement among youth. The idea was first proposed by Mahatma Gandhi in 1938 and later recommended by Dr. S. Radhakrishnan’s Committee in 1950. NSS encourages college and university students to participate in social service and nation-building activities, fostering a sense of responsibility and leadership.
